                </p>
    
                <p class="p22">
                    I’ve always loved spending way too much time on the computer,<br> and spent my teens tinkering with Photoshop and building crappy<br> websites.
                    But after getting a computer science degree, I realized<br> writing compilers wasn’t for me and decided to switch majors<br> completely and learn Mandarin instead.
                    Yet as it turns out, my path<br> would lead back to computers: after moving to China in 2006,<br> I ended up quitting my language studies and getting a job in Beijing<br> as a web designer.
                </p>
               
    
                <p class="p23">
                        
                    After coming back to France in 2007, I became a freelance UI designer,<br> working with companies such as Hipmunk, Intercom, and Le Monde.<br>
                    A few years later, I decided what I really wanted was to create my<br> own products, and set out to re-learn web programming.<br>
                    After moving to Japan in 2012 for my wife’s studies,<br> I now live in Kyoto and work on running developer surveys.
